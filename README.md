I'm a front-end engineer with over 6 years of experience building scalable, user-focused applications using **React**, **Next.js**, and **React Native**.

## 🚀 What I Do

- 🧑‍💻 Front-End Development: Crafting responsive, fast, and accessible UIs.
- 🔁 Full-Stack Projects: Combining **Front** and **Back**, in monorepo architectures.
- ⚙️ Backend: Building robust APIs with Node.js and Express/NestJS.
- 📊 AI & LLM Research: Using **RAG**, **ReAct**, and building custom agents to reduce hallucinations and improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- Backend: Node.js, Express, NestJS, Fastify  
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, TypeORM, Mongoose
