# 👋 Hi, I'm Reza Heydari

I'm a front-end engineer with over 6 years of experience building scalable, user-focused applications using **React**, **Next.js**, and **React Native**. I also have a growing passion for back-end technologies, especially **Node.js**, **NestJS** , and I'm currently expanding into the field of **AI engineering**.

## 🚀 What I Do

- 🧑‍💻 Front-End Development: Crafting responsive, fast, and accessible UIs.
- 🔁 Full-Stack Projects: Combining **Front** and **Back**, in monorepo architectures.
- ⚙️ Backend: Building robust APIs with Node.js and Express/NestJS.
- 📊 AI & LLM Research: Using **RAG**, **ReAct**, and building custom agents to reduce hallucinations and improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- Frontend: React, Next.js, React Native, TailwindCSS, Vite  
- Backend: Node.js, Express, NestJS, Fastify  
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, TypeORM, Mongoose  

## 🧠 Recent Focus
